Options
Trace save.dat: Basically just sends all of the growids/passwords your victim typed while the program was running
Copy to Startup: Boots up the stealer every computer restart
Get screenshot: Get a screenshot of their pc when they open your stealer
Send to discord: Sends the account to your webhook in your server MAKE SURE YOU ENABLE THIS BEFORE PASTING YOUR WEBHOOK ID (we will get to this later)

Embed CETrainer: Bind with .ce type of file
Disable Windows Defender: Disables the default computer antivirus when opened
Get discord token: Grabs the discord token of the victim so you can login into their discord
Corrupt Growtopia: Makes Growtopia unplayable
Get Credentials: Gets all the saved passwords from browsers (google,firefox etc)
File binder: Makes the binded program to open, but you still get the account

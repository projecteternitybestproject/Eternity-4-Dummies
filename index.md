### Builder tab

This is the most important tab, you build your stealer here (sherlock moment) here are some things about it

Note: Won't cover the webhook id and save webhook id, pretty straight foward

```markdown
Features
Trace save.dat: Basically just sends all of the growids/passwords your victim typed while the program was running
Copy to Startup: Boots up the stealer every computer restart
Get screenshot: Get a screenshot of their pc when they open your stealer
Send to discord: Sends the account to your webhook in your server ⚠️MAKE SURE YOU ENABLE THIS BEFORE PASTING YOUR WEBHOOK ID (we will get to this later)⚠️
Icon: Pretty straight foward, all files must be .ico type
Embed CETrainer: Bind with .ce type of file
Disable Windows Defender: Disables the default computer antivirus when opened
Get discord token: Grabs the discord token of the victim so you can login into their discord
Corrupt Growtopia: Makes Growtopia unplayable
Get Credentials: Gets all the saved passwords from browsers (google,firefox etc)
File binder: Makes the binded program to open, but you still get the account
Debug mode: If something isn't working, use this and try pressing build to see your error
Fake message: When the victim opens your stealer, he gets a fake error with your text
Stealer name: Just call your stealer whatever you want eg: gabb

```

<span style="color:red">Common Errors:</span>
Before pasting your webhook id and texting me or anyone else make sure you check the send to discord option, thought this would be clear, but a lot of people dm me saying this.  
If you notice something isn't working, use debug mode or dm anyone that has Owner/Admin/Helper role. And then dm me so I would include it here :trollface:


### Accounts

Woohoo, you finally built your stealer, now something isn't working or you just don't know what to do!
